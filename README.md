## Background

[Radix](https://www.radixdlt.com) is a platform for decentralized applications, specifically built for DeFi. Each smart contract, called a component on Radix, can emit events when transactions happen, including custom ones. An event may look somewhat like this:

```Rust
#[derive(ScryptoSbor, ScryptoEvent)]
pub struct InstantiateEvent {
    x_address: ResourceAddress,
    y_address: ResourceAddress,
    input_fee_rate: Decimal,
    liquidity_pool_address: ComponentAddress,
    pool_address: ComponentAddress,
}
```

These events are recorded inside of transactions in-sequence and stored on the Radix ledger. This allows developers to track the state of an application by reading events as they happen, and processing them in some specified way. That's what this library aims to achieve.

Events on Radix are encoded as SBOR (Scrypto Binary-friendly Object Representation), a custom format supporting binary and json representations. Radix provides Rust crates which can decode SBOR directly into the events as we defined them in a blueprint.

Each event has an **emitter**. This is the on-ledger entity which emitted the event. Events also have a **name**, which is the name of the event and its data type on ledger. These two identifiers are enough to map incoming events to handlers.

## General usage.

### Step 1: copy over event definitions.

```Rust
#[derive(ScryptoSbor, Debug)]
pub struct InstantiateEvent {
    x_address: ResourceAddress,
    y_address: ResourceAddress,
    context_fee_rate: Decimal,
    liquidity_pool_address: ComponentAddress,
    pool_address: ComponentAddress,
}
```

Above we see an event definition used in one of Ociswap's Basic pools. It derives at the very least `radix_engine_common::ScryptoSbor`, which is needed to decode it from binary SBOR. Copy this over to your project.

### Step 2: Define an application state.

This will get shared with every transaction handler, and they can update it. It should at least implement Clone. If you need to share this data with other pieces of code you may choose to store items wrapped in Rc, RefCell, Arc, Mutex, etc.

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct AppState {
    instantiate_events_seen: u64
}
```

### Step 3: implement handlers.

Write a handler which conforms to the predefined handler signature. It must take in the `EventHandlerContext`, which stores things like the current Radix transaction and the application state defined in step 1. I also takes the decoded event type as we copied over from our blueprint in step 1.

The `EventHandler` trait actually defines handlers to take in a `Vec<u8>` instead of the event type itself, but the `#[event_handler]` macro expands the function to handle decoding of the event for you.

```Rust
#[event_handler]
pub fn handle_instantiate_event(
    context: EventHandlerContext<AppState>,
    event: InstantiateEvent,
) -> Result<(), EventHandlerError> {
    info!(
        "Handling the {}th instantiate event: {:#?}",
        context.app_state.instantiate_events_seen, event
    );
    context.app_state.instantiate_events_seen += 1;
    Ok(())
}
```

This handler counts the amount of `InstantiateEvents` seen inside an app state variable as we go through the ledger.

It is possible to return errors from the event:

```rust
pub enum EventHandlerError {
    /// The event handler encountered an error and
    /// should be retried directly.
    /// This shouldn't be propagated up to the transaction handler.
    EventRetryError(anyhow::Error),
    /// The event handler encountered an error and
    /// the whole transaction should be retried.
    TransactionRetryError(anyhow::Error),
    /// The event handler encountered an unrecoverable
    /// error and the process should exit.
    UnrecoverableError(anyhow::Error),
}
```

By returning different errors, you may control how the stream behaves. It can retry handling the current event directly, retry the whole transaction handler, or exit completely. **Beware:** This could mean your handlers will be called multiple times if an error occurs. When using this option, ensure your handlers are somehow idempotent or atomic, so that running them multiple times is fine.

### Step 4: Register handlers.

Create a handler registry:

```Rust
let mut handler_registry: HandlerRegistry<AppState> =
    HandlerRegistry::new();
```

Add any handlers to the registry, identified by emitters and event names. In this case, we would like to handle `InstantiateEvent`s emitted by Ociswap's Basic pool package address.

```rust
// Add the instantiate event handler to the registry
handler_registry.add_handler(
    "package_rdx1p5l6dp3slnh9ycd7gk700czwlck9tujn0zpdnd0efw09n2zdnn0lzx",
    "InstantiateEvent",
    events::handle_instantiate_event,
);
```

Note that you can also register new handlers inside a handler. This is necessary when a new component is instantiated, to register handlers for that component.

### Step 5: Pick a source.

The library holds a few different transaction stream sources out of the box: A Radix Gateway stream and a file stream. It is also quite easy to implement your own custom stream, to allow getting events from a database, for example.

Let's use the gateway stream:

```Rust
    let stream = GatewayTransactionStream::new(
        1919391, // State version to start at
        100, // Items per page to request
        "https://mainnet.radixdlt.com".to_string(),
    );
```

A transaction stream implements the `TransactionStream` trait, which has a next() method. This method returns a new batch of transactions to process. It can also return one of the following errors:

```rust
pub enum TransactionStreamError {
    /// The stream is caught up with the latest transactions.
    /// The processor should wait for new transactions and try again.
    CaughtUp,
    /// The stream is finished and there are no more transactions.
    /// The processor should stop processing transactions.
    Finished,
    /// An error occurred while processing the stream.
    Error(String),
}
```

A gateway stream would never return `Finished`, because there will always be new transactions. A file stream would only return `Finished` when there are no more transactions. In that case, the stream would exit.

### Step 6: Define a transaction handler. (Optional)

To make the transaction stream have any kind of sense of ledger transactions, we must implement a custom transaction handler. This will allow us to do transaction-level operations. For example, if we want to store events in a database, and we want to push events to our database per ledger transaction atomically, we might want to use database transactions. Each time we get a transaction from the stream, we should start a database transaction and try to commit it after all the events have been handled. This is what we can do using a custom transaction handler.

A transaction handler takes in a `TransactionHandlerContext` struct, and returns a result with a `TransactionHandlerError`.

```rust
    fn transaction_handler(
        context: TransactionHandlerContext<AppState>,
    ) -> Result<(), TransactionHandlerError> {
        Ok(())
    }
```

The `TransactionHandlerContext` holds a reference to the `IncomingTransaction`. A method called `handle_events` is implemented on this struct. Calling it will iterate through the events inside the transactions and process the events which have handlers registered. It is highly recommended to use this method in your transaction handler. It is possible to implement your own loop, but it is an integral part of the library and also handles the event retry logic and some logging.

```rust
    fn transaction_handler(
        context: TransactionHandlerContext<AppState>,
    ) -> Result<(), TransactionHandlerError> {
        // Do something before handling events
        context
            .transaction
            .handle_events(context.app_state, context.handler_registry)?;
        // Do something after handling events
        Ok(())
    }
```

### Step 7: Run the stream processor.

The `TransactionStreamProcessor` is what ties everything together. It is responsible for getting new transactions from the stream we selected, and calling the transaction handler which in turn calls the event handlers.

Use the `run_with` method to start the processor, passing in the components we created and the initial app state.

```rust
TransactionStreamProcessor::run_with(
            stream,
            handler_registry,
            transaction_handler,
            AppState {
                instantiate_events_seen: 0
            },
        );
```

There also exists a `SimpleTransactionStreamProcessor`, which does not require a transaction handler. It simply calls the `handle_events` method from the previous step and nothing else.

## Some notes

- Currently, there are some pretty large dependencies like all of Scrypto and radix-engine-common. I should investigate if we can cut down since we don't use all of it.

- I believe there is a bug in the Radix engine toolkit causing my code to break. When I remove the one line which I think is broken, my code works. I've submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit/pull/110) for them to look at it, but they haven't yet responded.
